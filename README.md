- 👋 Hi, I’m @RiciVadillaPutraCaniago
- 👀 I’m interested in work that requires attention to detail, work related to compliance with regulations, planning, and organizing a group for a predetermined target.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to become a better leader by honing my skills in negotiation and managing the tasks assigned to me and my team.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people who can enable me to develop myself in my career and with a broad mindset. Wise people help me see problems from different angles.
- 📫 You can contact me via email at rici.VP@gmail.com, and then I will give you a telephone number that you can contact if we are close to an agreement to collaborate.
- 😄 Pronouns: I am a hard worker, have good leadership skills and am a detailed person with big responsibility and trustworthy. I can provide the best solution in working and working under pressure.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a competitive person, so I need a reference or some kind of role model or target to achieve to make me work even better. I am an impatient person, so I want all work to be done well and completely. I usually make a to-do list to help me work organized and faster. I'm a bit lazy, so I need to be smarter. I complete complex tasks in a simple way and do simple tasks in an easier way.
